## Essential tools - (almost) Universally useful

* [racer](https://github.com/phildawes/racer) - code completion for rust
* [rust clippy](https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy) - lints for common mistakes and potential performance improvements
* [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt) - The Rust-Lang endorsed formatting tool for consistent style across the rust ecosystem.
* [cargo edit](https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit) - edit cargo dependencies from command line (ala ```npm```)
* [cargo watch](https://github.com/passcod/cargo-watch) - recompile source code as it changes
* [cargo check](https://github.com/rsolomo/cargo-check) - instead of compiling source code, just get errors and warnings (less time/processor usage)
